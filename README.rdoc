== MineCart (working title)

WUP's (open-source/gem-based?) RoR shopping cart software. It uses Stripe for payment processing and customer management. It also allows for multiple storefronts called shelves (which can have configurable business rules per shelf) and master product records (which can be instantiated into independently editable items).
